1. There are 2 types of programming appporach :
a. Imperative programming : Says "how to do it"
ex: Going to market -> buy fish -> cook -> eat

b. Declarative programming: Says "what". Here i don't have to know how to do it, i just say what to do.
ex: Eat fish
ex1: (Sql) => select * from employee where id = 1;
ex2: (HTML) => <h1>Hello World</h1>

2. 
a. Java 8 introduced declarative programming using lambda expression.
b. Java 9-13 new features are introduced in lambda and functional programming

3. 	Imperative style:
	for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
		System.out.println(i);
		}

	Declartive style:
a.	IntStream numbers = IntStream.of(1,2,3,4,5);
	numbers.forEach(System.out::println);

b.	IntStream numbers = IntStream.rangeClose(1,5);
	numbers.forEach(System.out::println);
